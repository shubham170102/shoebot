# ShoeBot - Automated Shoe Purchase Bot

ShoeBot is an automated script that checks for availability and attempts to purchase shoes from a Shopify-based website. The bot continuously scans a specific product page for a given keyword and size. Once it detects the shoe is available, it adds the item to the cart and proceeds to checkout automatically.

## Features

- Checks availability of specific products on Shopify websites.
- Supports scanning for a keyword in product listings.
- Automatically selects the available shoe size.
- Adds the product to the cart.
- Automates the checkout process using shipping and payment details.

## Prerequisites

Before using the ShoeBot, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- A modern web browser (Google Chrome recommended)
- [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) installed for Selenium to interact with the browser
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other C# compatible editor

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubham170102/shoebot.git
cd shoebot
```

2. Install the required NuGet packages. Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
```bash
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
dotnet add package Nito.AsyncEx
dotnet add package Selenium.WebDriver
dotnet add package Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver
dotnet add package RestSharp
```

3. Ensure `ChromeDriver` is installed and added to your system's `PATH` so Selenium can launch Chrome.

## Configuration

Before running the bot, you need to configure the following parameters in the code:

- **Website URL**: In the `Main` method, update the `website` and `category` variables to point to the correct Shopify store and category.
```csharp
var website = "nrml.ca";            // Replace with your target website
var category = "/collections/footwear"; // Update with the correct product category
```
- **Keyword**: Update the `Keyword` variable with the specific product you want to search for.
```csharp
string Keyword = "CDG"; // Replace with the product name or brand you are looking for
```
- **Shoe Size**: If you are looking for a specific size, update the size variable.
```csharp
var size = "8";  // Replace with the shoe size you are searching for
```
- **User Details for Checkout**: Update the BuyAsync method with your own shipping and billing details.
```csharp
new KeyValuePair<string, string>("checkout[shipping_address][first_name]", "Shoe"),
new KeyValuePair<string, string>("checkout[shipping_address][last_name]", "Bot"),
new KeyValuePair<string, string>("checkout[email]", "shoebot0@gmail.com"),
new KeyValuePair<string, string>("checkout[shipping_address][phone]", "450-443-0358"),
new KeyValuePair<string, string>("checkout[shipping_address][address1]", "6400 Boulevard Taschereau"),
new KeyValuePair<string, string>("checkout[shipping_address][city]", "Brossard"),
new KeyValuePair<string, string>("checkout[shipping_address][zip]", "J4W3J2")
```

## Usage

### Run the Program:
Once you've updated the configuration, run the bot by executing the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

### Monitoring Product Availability
The bot will monitor the Shopify store for the specified product. When it finds a product matching your keyword, it will check if the specified size is available.

### Auto Add to Cart and Checkout
If the product is available, the bot will add it to the cart and proceed to checkout, automatically filling in the necessary details like shipping and payment information.

### Payment
The bot will generate the payment token and attempt to process the payment. If successful, it will display a success message in the terminal.

## How It Works

### Product Availability Check:
The bot sends a GET request to the Shopify storeâ€™s product API endpoint (e.g., `/products.json`). It retrieves the available products and checks for the specified keyword (e.g., a product name or brand like "CDG").

### Shoe Size Availability:
After finding the product, it checks the available variants (such as sizes) to see if your desired size is in stock.

### Add to Cart:
Once the product and size are found, it sends a POST request to the Shopify cart endpoint to add the product.

### Checkout:
The bot proceeds to the checkout page and fills in the required details for shipping, contact information, and payment, automating the process entirely.

### Completion:
The bot will either confirm the purchase or handle errors like declined payments, out-of-stock notices, or other processing issues.

## Customization

- **Additional Products**: To search for multiple keywords or products, you can expand the logic in the `Main` method to loop over an array of keywords.
  
- **Multi-size Support**: If you want to search for multiple sizes, modify the bot to loop through a list of sizes and attempt to purchase the first available size.

## Important Notes

- **Bot Limitations**: Some Shopify stores use CAPTCHA and other anti-bot technologies. This bot does not include CAPTCHA solving, so it may not work on all websites.
  
- **Legal Considerations**: Ensure you have permission to use automation tools on e-commerce websites. Some stores have policies against bots and may block your IP or account.

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot Not Finding Products**: Ensure the website's category and product data are accessible via the API and that the `keyword` is spelled correctly.
  
- **Errors During Checkout**: Check if the shipping or billing details are filled correctly and ensure that the website hasn't changed its checkout process.
